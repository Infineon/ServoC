/**
 * ServoC.cpp - A barebones servo library for Tower Pro SG-90 Servo Motor.
 *
 * A servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration.
 * It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback. It also requires a relatively sophisticated controller, often a dedicated module designed specifically for use with servomotors.
 * Servomotors are not a specific class of motor although the term servomotor is often used to refer to a motor suitable for use in a closed-loop control system..(Ref : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servomotor)
 *
